					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
					The mags programming club has a rich history, from ancient times to modern day.</br>
					The programming club started in ye olde year of 2019, started by Sir Alex Pullen the great. Together, its armies fought
					in the great war, which would later be known as New Zealand Informatics Competition 2019. Truly, it was a fierce battle.<br/>
					With the advance of COVID-19 in 2020, the programming club dwindled, and all was thought lost. Until, the hero came. Anatol. The holy warrior,
					armed with only a python and cup of java coffee, he took back the holy land (the ICT room) and started anew the programming club. The knowledge of the
					ancient art of programming could be spread once more thanks to him. May his reign last forever.

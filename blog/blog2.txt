20/08/2021 - Lockdown Programming
Hi Everyone!<br/><br/>
Hope you're all okay and on top of schoolwork this lockdown.<br/><br/>
It's time to look a bit more optimistically. This lockdown should not just be thought of as a setback, but also as a source of opportunities. Why say this on a programming club blog? Well, 'cause all this time at home means you have more time for programming, of course!<br/><br/>
Whether you are just starting, at an intermediate stage, or a professional-level programmer, this lockdown means you have more time than ever before to develop your programming skills, make something cool, or even try something new (the latter two aren't even limited to programming :) ).<br/><br/>
Stay Safe<br/>

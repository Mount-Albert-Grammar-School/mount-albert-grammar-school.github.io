31/07/2021 - Welcome to the Programming Club!
Welcome, everyone, to the MAGS Programming Club and its new website.<br/><br/>
The website is curently being hosted on the domain "magsprogramming.tk", however this is mostly temporary and will likely change
at some point in the future. Keep an eye out for that. I hope you are all going well with programming, and getting through your
assessments and working towards excellence in your exams. Whether they be scholarships, exams that could determine the fate of
your future career, or your first true high school exams in year 9.<br/><br/>
I have no idea what else to write here. I suppose I should say something motivational and memorable. Uh..., uhm... "dope not h-"..no,
that's not it. Alright. Let me try again.<br/><br/>
<strong>" I was once a little kid who wanted to be a game developer. Now I can write stupid blog posts in html. One day, you, too, can do this. So keep pursuing your goals... probably&#8482; "</strong><br/><br/>
Happy Programming!<br/>
